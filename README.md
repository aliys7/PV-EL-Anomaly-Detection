# PV-EL-Anomaly-Detection
A computer vision project for automated anomaly detection in electroluminescence (EL) images of photovoltaic modules, leveraging deep learning to identify manufacturing defects such as cracks, breaks, and misalignments in solar cells. Trained and evaluated using the PV ELAD dataset from Kaggle. </br> </br>
